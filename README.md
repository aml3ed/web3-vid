# Web3 Is Not About Crypto (Everyone Is Wrong)
## Intro
- By now, you've been inindated with Web3 advocates peddling tokens, NFTs, and straight up scams.
- And if you're like me, you've been revelling in the crash we've seen of crypto and the hype has died
- Why? Because the predatory people peddling this financialized vision of the future are missing what web3 is actually about:
- Decentralization - not financialization.
- So, in this video, I'm going to break down what I think a decentralized web actually looks like and what that means for creators, makers, and citizens of the internet.

## Ch1 - The Dawn of Web3
- Talk about conditions/problems that led to web3
	- Web1 being extremely disorganized, undiscoverable, and unscaleable
		- Led to platforms and user-generated content/curation
	- Web2's consolidation and exploitation (the business model origin)
		- Advertising
		- Gig economy
		- Lack of worker protection
	- Outside the technical problems: financial crash, social unrest, lack of trust in government
- Enter Bitcoin, Blockchain, and the Crypto Bro to save the day

## Ch2 - The Blockchain Bubble
- Talk about how Blockchain was supposed to solve all of these problems
- Talk about how/why it doesn't
- Talk about Technocratic over-reliance on tech and mask of money that causes people to disconnect from actual social issues
- Talk about how people in this time (just like in 20s) are insecure, markets are bloated with cash, and people are vulnerable of scams (origin of Ponzi scheme)
- Investors feel attaching Blockchain/Web3/Crypto to just the same implementations of solutions build hype/trust which allows them to make a ton more money
- In reality, all of these Blockchain/Crypto companies were either Solution In Search Of A Problem or straight up scams

## Ch3 - The Bust & Beyond
- The bust proved everyone is wrong
	- Value doesn't actually exist
	- Now people are wondering what the heck is web3 (and wondering if it's all just a scam)
- These problems still exist, but they've existed before
	- Industrial revolution gave rise to...
	- Public utilities, anti-trust, labor unions and legislation
- Modern solutions?
	- Anti-trust & Regulation
	- Data Portability
		- New Web Standards like ActivityPub
		- No Code making it easier to spin up platforms
	- Data Ownership
		- Data as public good and you get paid by people making these AIs
		- Gets rid of Surveliance Capitalism and companies getting away with not paying taxes
	- Democratic Ownership of the Web
		- Platform Cooperativism
		- User Unions
- Where could crypto actually be useful
	- Mint a token to be member of a global user union
	- Democratic control of the "in-game currency" of a platform
- To Devs:
	- Remember that the tech should help solve REAL problems for people - so it might not be needed
	- It's a tool in the arsenal, not a silver bullet

## Conclusion / CTA
- Web3 is about data portability, platform ownership, and digital labor rights. Not financialization of life in the metaverse.
- The tech is just a tool that enables those things to happen - don't believe the hype that this tech will solve social problems. Tech enables **people** to solve social problems.
- We need voices, leaders, and adcovates in this space. So let's keep the conversation going (join the discord)
