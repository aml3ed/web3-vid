Hi friends ðŸ‘‹,

If you're like me, I'm sure you've been enjoying the brief reprieve of technocratic, liberatarian, crypto bros peddling the predatory, financialized vision of the future they call Web3.

*MONTAGE OF ALL THE CRAZY BULLSHIT GOING ON*

And although you should pay no attention to the charlatans and mechanical keyboard warriors running ponzi schemes and scams, you should be aware that this "Web3" transition is actually a thing.

It's just that everyone talking about it talks way too much about the tech and not nearly enough about you, the people.

So, in this video, I'm going to explain what Web3 actually is, why it really has nothing to do with crypto, and how looking to the past can give us advice on how we - as the citizens of the internet - can shape this next era of the web to be more open, democratic and just.

Let's get into it.

*CH1. WHAT THE F IS WEB3*

To fully understand how we got here, we have to go back...to the 90s.

*90s KIDS WILL KNOWN MONTAGE*

Welcome to the wild west of web 1.0. This is a time where everyone is exploring and trying to figure out what the heck this "Internet" thing is - in-between yelling at their older sister to get off the phone so they can use the modem.

*DIAL TONE SOUND EFFECT*

And this year, 1997, marks a huge milestone for the web. We've just passed one million websites (*applause and confetti effect*). Just four years ago, in 1993, there were only 130. The internet went from being listable on a single sheet of paper to requiring its own Yellow Pages.

*I just realized basically anyone born past 2000 won't get this reference. Dear lord.*.

Now obviously, that exponential growth in content has caused some serious growing pains. And Yahoo! - an actual human-organized index of thousands of websites - just cannot keep up. Users are annoyed at how disorganized and clunky the internet feels and publishers - people who want to put stuff on the web - are frustrated that, without Yahoo indexing their site, they are essentially invisible.





 So internet users are super annoyed at how disorganized the web feels,  website owners are super annoyed that they can't be discovered, and 

right now, Sergei Brin and Larry Page are at Stanford about to publish a paper on how 

But at this time, there are essentially two kinds of web sites - text with links, and games.


 And all of the content on these blogs, online catologues, and marketing pages are created and distrubuted by the website owner.

There's no content aggregation, there's no social media, essentially everything people are publishing they are doing by themselves - and they're doing it a lot.

In 1993, there were 130 recorded websites on the internet. 130. That's 13 pages of google. The whole internet.
